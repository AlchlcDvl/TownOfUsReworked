Changelog
- Addition: New 'Default' preset for those who want to reset their settings to default
- Addition: New 'Vanilla' gamemode, no idea why I added it so just roll with it
- Addition: Added LevelImpostor compatibility
- Improvement: Settings now loop (for example if the setting allows for the range 1 to 10, moving beyond 10 will result in the setting becoming 1)
- Changes: None of the Neutral (Evil) roles end the game anymore, instead making them win brings about a penalty to players
- Critical Fix: Another attempt at fixing games not ending properly
- Critical Fix: MCI works now (albiet with some bugs of its own)! Controls will be coming later so until then, just press random buttons
- Bug Fix: Presets can now be loaded properly
- Bug Fix: Fixed changelogs appearing as "Fetching..." always
- Bug Fix: Fixed the Corrupted kill button not lighting up properly
- Bug Fix: Fixed the Speci vent not having the proper vent connections
- Visual Fix: Fixed Detective footprints being absolutely huge
- Role Fix: Fixed Retributionist mediate button not showing up
- Role Fix: Fixed Poisoner returning an Intruder win rather than a Syndicate one
- Removal: Removed the 'Footprint Size' settings because it's kind of useless
