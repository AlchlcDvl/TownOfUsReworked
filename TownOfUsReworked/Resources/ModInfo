Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reworked is essentially a weird mishmash of code from Town Of Us Reactivated and its forks plus some of my own code. Credits to the parties have already been given. This mod has several reworks and additions which I believe fit the mod better. Plus, the more layers there are, the more unique a player's experience will be each game. If I've missed anything, let me know via Discord.

Now that you know the basic info, if you want to know more try using the other info commands, visiting the GitHub page or joining my discord. Happy ejections!
