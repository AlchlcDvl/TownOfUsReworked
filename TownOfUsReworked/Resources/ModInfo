Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reactivated but better! (hopefully)

This mod is a mish mash of code and ideas from different games, mods and forks, mainly from Town Of Salem, Town Of Us Reactivated and The Other Roles. Enjoy the chaos that comes out as a result!

- Update: Updated BepInEx to 6.0.0-be.692
