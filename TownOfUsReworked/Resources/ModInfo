Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reactivated but better! (hopefully)

This mod is a mish mash of code and ideas from different mods and forks, mainly from Town Of Us Reactivated and The Other Roles. Enjoy the chaos that comes out as a result!

- Change: Actor can now get a randomised list (instead of a fixed one) of roles present in the game to be guessed as
