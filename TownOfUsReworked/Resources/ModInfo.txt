Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reactivated but better! (hopefully)

This mod is a mish mash of code and ideas from different games, mods and forks, mainly from Town Of Salem, Town Of Us Reactivated and The Other Roles. Enjoy the chaos that comes out as a result!

If you want to know more try using the other info commands, visiting the %github% page or joining the %discord% server. Happy ejections!

New!
- Recode: The custom options have been given a full recode to work even better than before and include many new features and different new options
- Addition: Colorblind now has grayscale vision
- Return: Reporting bodies now spreads infections and douses (I had removed it a while back due to bugs, but it's back now)

Changes!
- Improvement: Touched up on oudated code to ensure they all function better
- Rename: Objectifiers have now been renamed to Dispositions, due to the new name being more fitting
- Change: Jackal recruits can now need to only be of opposite factions so it has more flexible matchups
- Change: Shifter now has a player menu to swap through to prevent auto confirms
- Change: Bastion can now spawn in Killing Only
- Change: Raised the min player requirement for Jackal spawn from 6 to 7
- Change: Neutral defecting Spellslingers and Rebel-Spellslingers can now win solo by spellbinding everyone
- Change: Blocks are now only revealed when you try to do something to avoid identification of blockers (yes, Banshee too because it's funny)
- Change: The kill animation now has a colored background (now that I know how to change this, be prepared for some pseudo-custom kill animations)
- Nerf: Dracula can now only convert once per round (because it was the only NN role that wasn't limited in its conversions)
- Revert: Partially reverted changes to custom colors because it has a hand in the fps issue
- Removed: Removed the /setcolor chat command due to it being essentially useless
- Update: Updated to Among Us 2024.9.4
- Update: Updated to BepInEx 6.0.0-be.716
- Update: Updated to Reactor 2.3.1
