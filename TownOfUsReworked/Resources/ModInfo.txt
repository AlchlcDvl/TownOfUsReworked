Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reactivated but better! (hopefully)

This mod is a mishmash of code and ideas from different games, mods and forks, mainly from Town Of Salem, Town Of Us Reactivated and The Other Roles. Enjoy the chaos that comes out as a result!

If you want to know more, try using info commands, visiting the %github% page or joining the %discord% server. Happy ejections!

Changes!
- Recode: Overhauled a lot of the code base in favour of optimisation and avoiding potential issues
- Rework: Dictator no longer ejects 3 players at a time; instead, they only pick a singular player to eject and have gained ability charges to compensate
- Rework: Altruist and Necromancer now need to gain mana from bodies (thereby cleaning them) to be able to revive players
- Change: Actor role change now has a priority system; it will prioritise roles that are not currently in game, followed by those that are dead and lastly any other role
- Change: Arsonists, when igniting, will remove the coolant off those doused by a Cryomaniac
- Change: Cryomaniacs, when freezing, will remove the gasoline off those doused by an Arsonist
- Change: Player names will no longer appear in your vision until more of their body is exposed to your vision
- Change: The "Pure Crew" is now a "Pure Player" game modifier, so it's no longer limited to just Crew roles (originally it was a bandaid fix for task completion issues; those were resolved ages ago)
- Change: The /help command now also provides info on other commands if you specify a command name after it
- Change: Dictators and Mayors cannot reveal themselves if there is another of the same role revealed, however unrevealed Dictators can still call a tribunal
- Change: You can no longer report bodies in the dark, your report button will light
- Change: Teleporters and Godfather-Teleporters now also have to go through an animation to teleport
- Nerf: Serial Killers will now only kill roleblockers when they are in blood lust mode; however, they will still be roleblock immune the entire game
- Improvement: Improved the mod's loaders
- Improvement: Mod assets are now no longer loaded all at once; they are now only loaded and stored when needed to ensure assets that are never needed don't hog memory
- Improvement: Made general optimisations to improve the mod's runtime
- Improvement: The mod is now more integrated into the game, allowing for a smoother experience
- Improvement: Portal animations now occur within the player's vision, to not expose player positions
- Removed: Removed the "Lobby Cap" toggle in the testing menu due to it not actually functioning and being too much of a hassle to actually get working
- Removed: Removed Vampire Hunter as it's too hard of a counter to the Undead (and I couldn't really think of role names for the other sub faction counters)
