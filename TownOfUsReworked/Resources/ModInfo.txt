Welcome to Town Of Us Reworked %modversion%!

Town Of Us Reactivated but better! (hopefully)

This mod is a mish mash of code and ideas from different games, mods and forks, mainly from Town Of Salem, Town Of Us Reactivated and The Other Roles. Enjoy the chaos that comes out as a result!

If you want to know more try using the other info commands, visiting the %github% page or joining the %discord% server. Happy ejections!

New!
- Addition: The main menu buttons now fashion their own icons

Changes!
- Rework: Dictator no longer ejects 3 players at a time, instead they pick a singular player to eject and instead has gained ability charges to compensate
- Nerf: Vampire Hunters turned Vigilantes will always have one bullet left
- Improvement: Improved the mod's asset loaders
- Improvement: Assets are now no longer loaded all at once, they are now only loaded and stored when needed to ensure assets that are never needed don't hog memory
- Improvement: Made general optimsations to improve the mod's intensity

Fixes!
- Role: Fixed the Mayor and Dictator buttons not disappearing when they should
- Compatibility: Fixed the elavator not being usable for postmortal roles
- General: Fixed needing to increase the count in Custom/Classic game modes to be able to spawn roles in All Any
- General: Fixed All Any role gen being a bit broken in other aspects

Known Bugs :(
- Critically slow fps for everyone, with the host having it the worst, a fix is in progress and the severity has been considerably reduced
