**Type**
Is it a player layer or a feature/qol improvement that you want to see?

**Describe**
A clear and concise description of what you want.

**Code Snippets/Suggestions**
If it's a feature that you can attempt to add by yourself, go ahead and make a pull request for it or maybe share some code in here or in the discord for me or a contributor to look over.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
It is also preferable you turn on logs for the mod and attach the log file along with the bug report for easier bug fixing on my end.
