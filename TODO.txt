Partially Done-
- Added Camouflaged Meetings (although it doesn't work yet)
- Better buttons

- Rework Spy by giving it abilities from the Agent from Town Of Impostors
- Rework Undertaker into being able to hide bodies in vents
- Rework Guardian Angel so that they should win only when their target lives to the end, not wins (even if the target loses, like a Crewmate target stuck in a 2v2 with Impostors, the Guardian Angel will still win)
